# NLP for Sentiment Analysis in Internal Communications

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze sentiment in internal organizational communications. The goal is to help organizations understand employee mood, identify emerging concerns, and improve workplace engagement through data-driven insights derived from textual feedback.

It is designed as a practical sentiment analysis pipeline that can be adapted for HR analytics, internal surveys, feedback forms, and employee engagement monitoring.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform sentiment classification on internal communication text
* Identify positive, neutral, and negative sentiment trends
* Support HR and leadership decision-making with data insights
* Demonstrate NLP workflow from preprocessing to model evaluation

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, normalization)
* Stopword removal
* Feature extraction (TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words)
* Sentiment classification model
* Performance evaluation metrics
* Modular and extensible structure

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**
   Internal communication text (e.g., survey responses, feedback forms).

2. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Lowercasing
   * Removing punctuation and special characters
   * Tokenization
   * Stopword removal
   * Lemmatization (optional)

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Bag-of-Words
   * TF-IDF Vectorization

4. **Modeling**

   * Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / SVM (depending on implementation)
   * Training & testing split

5. **Evaluation**

   * Accuracy
   * Precision
   * Recall
   * F1-Score
   * Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Expected Output

* Sentiment classification (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
* Performance metrics
* Insight summary for decision-makers
